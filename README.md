# K-Means-Parallelization
K-Means is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that groups data into K clusters. It iteratively assigns points to the nearest centroid and recalculates centroids until convergence. Though simple, it becomes computationally expensive for large datasets, making it ideal for parallelization studies.
